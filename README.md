# **Accenture North America Data Analytics and Visualization Job Simulation**
Platform: Forage
Date: September 2024

**Overview**

This repository showcases my work from the Accenture Data Analytics and Visualization Job Simulation, completed in September 2024. The simulation involved working as a Data Analyst for a hypothetical social media client. I cleaned, modeled, and analyzed 7 datasets to uncover content trends, which helped inform strategic business decisions. My work included preparing a PowerPoint deck and a video presentation to communicate key insights to both the client and internal stakeholders.

**Key Skills Developed**


Communication: Presented complex findings in a clear, client-focused manner.

Data Analysis: Analyzed large datasets to generate actionable insights.

Data Modeling: Structured data models to support analysis.

Data Understanding: Gained deep insights into client data.

Data Visualization: Created visuals to enhance understanding of insights.

Presentations: Developed client-ready decks and video presentations.

Project Planning: Managed workflow to meet deadlines.

Public Speaking: Delivered findings professionally and clearly.

Storytelling: Crafted a narrative to effectively communicate data insights.

Strategy: Provided recommendations based on data-driven findings.

Teamwork: Simulated collaboration in a project team environment.

**How This Experience Prepares Me for a Role at Accenture**

Participating in this job simulation gave me hands-on experience with data analytics and visualization in a realistic context. I enjoyed cleaning, modeling, and analyzing data, as well as presenting insights in a meaningful way. This experience made me even more excited to contribute to a dynamic team at Accenture, where I can apply these skills to real-world projects.

**Tasks I Completed:**

Task 1
This was an MCQ (Multiple Choice Question) task, and it was quite easy to solve.

Task 2
There were CSV files that needed to be cleaned using either Excel or SQL, depending on which tool was easier to use. I chose SQL because, in the end, we needed to concatenate all the tables into one, and it was simpler for me to do that with SQL. However, Excel could also be used for this task.



Task 3
The third task was to create a PowerPoint presentation based on the analysis.

Task 4
In this task, we had to present the PowerPoint presentation we created in Task 3 by making our video explaining the content of the presentation.
